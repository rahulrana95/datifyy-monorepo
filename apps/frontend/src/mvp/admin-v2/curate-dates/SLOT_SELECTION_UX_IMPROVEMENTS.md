# Slot Selection UX Improvements

## Overview
Comprehensive improvements to the slot selection experience in Curate Dates, preventing overlapping content and providing better visual feedback for scheduled dates.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Modal-Based Slot Selection
- **New Component**: `SlotSelectionModal` provides a dedicated modal for slot selection
- **Benefits**:
  - No content overlap with tables
  - Full-screen experience for better visibility
  - Clear separation from main workflow
  - Dedicated space for all slot options

### 2. Scheduled Date Indication
- **Visual Differentiation**: Users with scheduled dates are highlighted differently
  - Green background (`green.50`)
  - Green left border (4px solid)
  - Check circle icon next to name
  - "Date Scheduled" badge instead of "View Slots" button
  - Not clickable (cursor: not-allowed)
  - Slightly reduced opacity (0.8)

### 3. Modal Features
- **Size**: Extra large (`6xl`) for comfortable viewing
- **Header Information**:
  - Clear title "Select Time Slots"
  - Badge counts for online/offline slots
  - Match user information with avatar and details
- **Scrollable Content**: Inside scrolling for long slot lists
- **Action Buttons**:
  - Cancel button to close without changes
  - Confirm button (disabled until slot selected)

### 4. Improved Slot Selection Flow
1. Click "View Slots" or select a match → Modal opens
2. Select desired slot(s) in the modal
3. Click "Confirm Selection" → Modal closes
4. Page automatically scrolls to summary section
5. Summary shows selected slots with "Change Slot" button

### 5. Edit Slot Capability
- **Change Slot Button**: Added to CurationSummary
- Allows users to reopen modal and change selection
- Located next to "Selected Date & Time" header
- Uses edit icon for clarity

### 6. Enhanced Slot Display
- **Larger Buttons**: Size increased from `sm` to `md`
- **Better Layout**: Flexible height with proper padding
- **Clear Time Labels**: Both short and full time descriptions
- **Visual Icons**: Time-of-day emojis for quick recognition

### 7. Mock Data Updates
- **Scheduled Date Simulation**: 30% of suggested matches have scheduled dates
- **Scheduled Date Info**: Includes:
  - Date ID
  - Scheduled date/time
  - Assigned slot
  - Other user information
