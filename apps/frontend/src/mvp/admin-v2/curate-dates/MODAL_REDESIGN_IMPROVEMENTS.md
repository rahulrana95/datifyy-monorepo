# Modal Redesign Improvements

## Overview
Complete redesign of the slot selection modal to include the entire date configuration flow within the modal, preventing content overlap and improving UX.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Complete Flow in Modal
- **All-in-One**: Both slot selection and date configuration are now inside the modal
- **No Page Scrolling**: Everything happens within the modal boundaries
- **Cleaner Layout**: Main page only shows user and match selection

### 2. Two-Step Process with Stepper
- **Step 1**: Select Slot - Choose time slot
- **Step 2**: Configure Date - Add genie, location, and finalize
- **Visual Progress**: Stepper component shows current step
- **Easy Navigation**: Back/Continue buttons between steps

### 3. Fixed Header Layout
- **No Overlap**: Close button positioned properly (top-right with padding)
- **Clear Title**: "Configure Date" as main header
- **Stepper Below**: Progress indicator doesn't interfere with close button

### 4. Enhanced Match Display
- **Both Users Shown**: Selected user and match displayed side-by-side
- **Visual Connection**: Check icon between users shows match
- **Key Info**: Age, city, and match score prominently displayed
- **Slot Counts**: Common online/offline slots shown as badges

### 5. Modal Behavior
- **Size**: Extra large (6xl) for comfortable viewing
- **No Accidental Close**: `closeOnOverlayClick={false}` prevents mistakes
- **State Management**: Current view tracked internally
- **Reset on Close**: Returns to slot selection when reopened

### 6. Improved Button Flow
- **Slot Selection**:
  - "Cancel" - Closes modal
  - "Continue to Configuration" - Proceeds to step 2 (disabled until slot selected)
- **Configuration**:
  - "Back to Slots" - Returns to step 1
  - "Close" - Closes modal
  - Create Date button inside CurationSummary

### 7. Visual Enhancements
- **Gray Background**: Match info section has subtle background
- **Grid Layout**: Users displayed in responsive grid
- **Proper Spacing**: Consistent padding and margins
- **Dividers**: Clear separation between sections

## User Flow

1. **Select Match**: Click "View Slots" on a match
2. **Modal Opens**: Shows both users and available slots
3. **Select Slot**: Choose preferred time slot
4. **Continue**: Click "Continue to Configuration"
5. **Configure**: Add genie, location (if offline)
6. **Create Date**: Complete the process within modal
7. **Success**: Modal closes after successful creation

## Benefits

1. **No Overlap**: All content contained within modal
2. **Clear Process**: Step-by-step progression
3. **Better Context**: Users always visible during configuration
4. **Reduced Scrolling**: Everything accessible without page scroll
5. **Professional Look**: Clean, modern interface
6. **Error Prevention**: Can't accidentally close during process

## Technical Details
